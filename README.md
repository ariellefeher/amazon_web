# amazon_web
Welcome to my Amazon Scraper! 
In order to use, run the following command in the terminal (of the main.py code): uvicorn main:app --reload
Then click on the homepage.html page to begin searching :)

I added a css page to make the website look nicer (and similar to the colours and fonts of amazon)
